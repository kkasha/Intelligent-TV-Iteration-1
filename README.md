With ultrasonic ranging sensor and buzzer

The idea was to install a sensor to "see" how far kids are from the TV. If they get closer than a predefined safe distance, then sound a loud buzzer so as to deter them.

For this I took Sunfounder's HC-SR04 ultrasonic ranging module and hooked it up with an active buzzer.
